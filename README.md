# Hello, my name is Ryan Dudek.
I once had convinced a boss of mine that my middle name was Effin. At first he thought I said _Elvin_, but I told him I was _AWESOME_ and not an _ELF_ (no offense to elves or elf lovers). That is a true story. I am a front end web developer, which is to say, I make the internets (at least this is how I explain it to my mom).

### This is me:

### And this is also me:

### I also clean up nicely:

## Currently
I am a Senior Front End Web Developer (aka _Vice President of Keeping it Awesome_) at Epam Systems in Conshochocken, PA. Outside of work, I am a very active person and I drink way too much coffee (also known as never drinking enough coffee). You can find me riding and racing bicycles, hiking, camping, making fun of myself, and (shittily) [photoshopping pictures](http://badphotoslops.tumblr.com) of my friends/family/coworkers. I like video games, but I never have enough time to play them. I'm not great at social networking, but you can read [my tweets about bike racing](https://twitter.com/kelpiuscycling) or look at [my pictures of mostly bike races and coffee](https://instagram.com/ryaneffindudek) if you're into that.

### So long, and thanks for all the fish,
