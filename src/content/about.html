  <p class="rd-about-content">I am Ryan Dudek, a software engineer based out of (not always) sunny Philadelphia. I am passionate about building awesome and accessible user experiences. I consider myself to be framework agnostic, but have experience with many different development platforms.</p>
  <p class="rd-about-content">Currently, I am a UX Tech Lead (aka _Vice President of Keeping it Awesome_) at [EY Design Studio PHL](http://studio.ey.com/) in Philadelphia, PA. If you are interested in learning more about me, check out my [resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryandudek/ryandudek.github.io/develop/resources/Ryan_Dudek-resume.pdf). When I am not online, I enjoy the great outdoors, coffee, art, photography, cooking, baking, reading, and being active. Ask me about my many fake business ventures that are run by my pseudonym - Randy Duke.</p>

    So long, and thanks for all the fish,<br />
